#HCI Project 001 - Jeffrey Chen

- What : Base project for a simple react + bootstrap made dashboard
- Where : https://github.com/flatlogic/react-dashboard
- Why : I wanted to focus on the UX/UI design of the project and not waste time setting up because I only registered for the class a few days ago.
